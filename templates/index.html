<h2>Hello</h2>

<section>
    <p>
        I am Karan and I usually go by the handle <mark class="highlight-handle">@mrkaran</mark> on the
        interwebz. I work at <a href="https://zerodha.com">Zerodha</a> where I
        focus mainly on Devops practices, Containers, and Kubernetes. I've started
        my journey in DevOps fairly recently and prior to this I was a Fullstack
        developer building web applications using Python, JS and, Golang.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to <a href="/projects/">tinker</a> stuff around monitoring and observability systems, DNS
        and the underlying networking stack. I also happen to listen to a lot of
        <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/thetechfreak">music</a> and maintain a Spotify <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5dvbrw93FgUhsZdbnpF3JM">
            playlist</a> of some good indie artists
        I've
        discovered.
