# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm Anas — an engineer at [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) where I craft solutions in backend engineering and distributed systems. I'm passionate about building robust systems and love diving deep into the intricacies of system design.

I enjoy tinkering with projects that challenge me in backend engineering, distributed systems, and everything in between. You'll often find me experimenting with new technologies and contributing to the tech ecosystem.

When I'm not coding, I'm committed to my fitness journey at the gym, exploring my culinary skills in the kitchen, or embarking on spontaneous travel adventures. These impromptu trips help me maintain a fresh perspective on both life and code.
