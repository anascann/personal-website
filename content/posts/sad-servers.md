## Introduction to SadServers

Recently, I stumbled upon [sadservers](sadservers.com), an innovative site described as "Like LeetCode for Linux". The premise is simple yet unique: you are given access to a full remote Linux server with a pre-configured problem. Your mission is to diagnose and fix the issues in a fixed time window.

With the goal of documenting my journey through these challenges and sharing the knowledge gained, I decided to not only tackle these puzzles but also to record my solutions in a video format. The format is twofold in its purpose: it allows me to reflect on my problem-solving approach and provides a resource for others who may encounter similar problems, whether in real-world scenarios or in preparation for an SRE/DevOps interview.

## The Learning Curve

Each server presented a different issue, from misconfigured network settings to services failing to start, from permission nightmares to resource overutilization. One server, for instance, had a failing database service because of a disk full partition. The cause? A runaway log file. Another had a web server throwing 500 errors because of incorrect file permissions.

## Recording the Solutions

The video recordings start with an introduction to the problem and my initial thoughts. Viewers can see my screen as I work through the issue, making the troubleshooting process transparent and educational. The commentary explains my thought process, the tools used, and the solutions applied.
